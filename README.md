# TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Project Steps
The project consists of the following steps:
1. Get and Explore the Data

2. Implement Preprocessing Functions:
   - Lookup Table
   - Tokenize Punctuation
   - Pre-process all the data and save it
   - Input Batching

3. Build the Neural Network:
   - Model Architecture 
   - Defining Forward and Backpropagation


4. Neural Network Training
   - Hyperparameters
   - Training

5. Generate TV Script

## Instructions
To complete the project, you need to install the following libraries:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  

You can find the data [here](https://github.com/Faisal-AlDhuwayhi/TV-Script-Generation/tree/master/data). The ```helper.py``` and ```problem_unittests.py``` are helpful files used to finish the project.
